# Bad Apple But It's a Blender Addon

The title pretty much says it all, an addon that displays the Bad Apple animation via Blender's checkbox properties.

## Installation

Download the .zip file from the release page and install via `Edit > Preferences > Addons > Install`. Blender should automatically recognize the file as an add-on.

## Why was this made???

I don't know, it was just a fun little project I did for laughs.
